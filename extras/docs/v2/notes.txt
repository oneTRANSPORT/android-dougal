Architecture notes
------------------

Nodes:
Application Entity <-- the bit we are interested in
Common Services Entity <-- in scope?
Network Services Entity

CSE functions:
Application and service layer management
  Upgrade AEs---Google Play?
Communication management/delivery handling
  AE can request transport to a specific CSE/AE
Data management and repository
  AE writes ICs
Device management
  Relevance to AEs?
Discovery
  AEs may discover DCs and CIs on a CSE
Group management
  Relevance to AEs?
Location
  AE pushes location to CSE?
Network service exposure/service ex+triggering
  Relevance to AEs?
Registration
  AE registers with a CSE---does this work yet?
Security
  More fine-grained than just basic auth?  Access control
Service charging and accounting
  Relevance to AE?
Subscription and notification
  CSE needs to send Google Cloud Messages?  SMS?  Email?

Requests:
Blocking and non-blocking
Create
  Content body contains data to be stored
Retrieve
  Content body may contain required fields
Update
  As create
Delete
  No content body required
Notify
  Content is the notification information

Responses:
Server may delay execution (return acknowledgement) and report result later?

Device triggering support, SMS?

Location request

(21) Server-side modifications for subscriptions

Usage and charging
As a developer I want to charge applications for access to my data container
(5) As an application I want to be blocked from access to the server if I  have run out of credit so that I don't run up crazy charges
