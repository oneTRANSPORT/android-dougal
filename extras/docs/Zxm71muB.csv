5697b651a4479171a10d1c5d,Assumptions,https://trello.com/c/fOaVVQrS/28-assumptions,"'- Access will be via the HTTP API 
- JSON will be used not XML
- Basic Authentication over SSL
- Modelling of the API will be over oneM2M entities, rather than oneTRANSPORT models - there is no abstraction of the oneM2M stuff. E.g. a container API, rather than a car park API
- All server development is complete ;-)
- Applications do not need to clean-up their data containers when they are deleted
- Notifications would use the native mechanism, rather than being HTTP push - because HTTP push would have an impact on battery life
- Credit checks need to be made against another external server. Or the oneTRANSPORT server could contain the credit for the user.
- When retrieving usage information, it is not-granular and only shows the total application usage
- There is no geographical filtering for discovery of data containers
- It is not possible to support external location service in the API, as each one could be different
- The server is available for development
- Estimates do not contain unit tests, the unit tests would include 50%
- Example application demonstrates creating an app, creating a container and adding some device data.
